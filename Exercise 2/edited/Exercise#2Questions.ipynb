    "In the lectures, we solved the coupled-rate equations for a multi-level laser system assuming a *steady-state*. In the steady-state, the laser output is constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when a laser is first switched on, *relaxation oscillations* can occur before the steady-state is reached, i.e. the laser output intensity exhbitis a series of regularly spaced spikes that decay away - even with constant pumping! \n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of *relaxation oscillations* is best understood when you have familiarised yourself with gain clamping (Lecture 5.4): As the laser intensity increases from zero it overshoots the steady-state intensity. This depletes the gain due to gain saturation, which in turn reduces the intensity which allows the gain to be pumped up again, and so on. This leads to intensity spikes that eventually settle down to a constant, steady-state intensity.\n",

    "This behaviour is described by two coupled, nonlinear differential equations. These cannot be solved analytically in the general case.\n",
